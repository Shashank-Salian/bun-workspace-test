# Bun Workspace Test

A modern monorepo built with [Bun](https://bun.sh) featuring a React frontend, Hono backend for AWS Lambda, and shared Zod schemas.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

This monorepo contains:

- **Frontend** (`apps/frontend/`) - React application with React Router
- **Backend** (`apps/backend/`) - [Hono](https://hono.dev) REST API for AWS Lambda functions
- **Shared Package** (`packages/zod-schemas/`) - Shared Zod validation schemas used by both frontend and backend

## üìã Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** - Fast JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **[AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)** - For local Lambda development
- **Node.js** (for AWS SAM compatibility)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd bun-workspace-test
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all dependencies across the monorepo:

```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Create environment files with your database configuration:

```bash
# For backend
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
```

Make sure to set your database URL in the `.env` file:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Frontend Development

The frontend is a React application with React Router.

```bash
cd apps/frontend
bun run dev
```

This will start the development server, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend Development

The backend is a Hono application designed to run as AWS Lambda functions. Development requires two steps:

#### Step 1: Start the Build Process

In your first terminal, start the build process with watch mode:

```bash
cd apps/backend
bun run dev
```

This starts esbuild in watch mode to automatically rebuild when you make changes.

#### Step 2: Start Local AWS Lambda Environment

In a second terminal, start the AWS SAM local environment:

```bash
cd apps/backend
bun run start-local
```

This will use AWS SAM to simulate the Lambda environment locally.

## üì¶ Shared Package

The `@/zod-schemas` package contains shared validation schemas that can be used in both frontend and backend:

```typescript
import { usersSchema, categoriesSchema } from "@zod-schemas";
```

```bash
# Install dependencies for all workspaces
bun install

# Run a command in a specific workspace
bun --filter backend run build
bun --filter frontend run dev

# Run tests across all workspaces
bun run test
```
